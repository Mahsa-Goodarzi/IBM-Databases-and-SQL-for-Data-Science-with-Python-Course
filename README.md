# IBM Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

This repository contains my coursework and completed projects for the [**Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) course, provided by **IBM** on **Coursera**.

The notebooks demonstrate the integration of SQL with Python for data analysis, utilizing real-world datasets related to the City of Chicago (Census, Public Schools, and Crime data).

## Repository Contents

* **1. Creating tables, inserting and querying Data:** Introduction to the Python `sqlite3` library, DDL (Create/Drop), and DML (Insert/Select) operations.
* **2. Accessing Databases with SQL magic:** Utilizing Jupyter SQL Magic (`%sql`) extensions to write queries directly within notebook cells.
* **3. Analyzing a real-world data-set:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on socioeconomic indicators using SQL and Seaborn for visualization.
* **4. Working with a real-world data-set:** Advanced querying techniques including aggregations, sub-queries, and joins on the Chicago Public Schools dataset.
* **5. Final Assignment:** A comprehensive analysis joining three distinct datasets (Census, Crime, and Schools) to answer complex business questions and solve data science problems.

## Technologies & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **SQL (SQLite)**
* **Pandas:** For converting SQL query results into DataFrames for analysis.
* **sqlite3:** Python DB-API for database connection.
* **ipython-sql:** For executing SQL commands directly in Jupyter.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Key Concepts Covered

* **Database Connection:** Connecting to SQLite databases using Python.
* **Data Engineering:** Creating tables and loading data from CSV files into database tables.
* **Querying:** Filtering, sorting, grouping, and joining data across multiple tables.
* **Integration:** Bridging SQL databases with Python Data Science tools (Pandas/NumPy).
